                <p class="text-faded">A picture’s worth a thousand words. But for custom flower orders, that picture won’t exist until after the flower arrangement is completed. Instead, clients and florists have to find other ways to communicate their artistic vision: emails, phone calls, Pinterest inspiration. It’s a process that takes trial and error, especially when a client doesn’t know what they want.
                    At Foxtail Creates, we want to turn floral design ideas into visual images early on in the process. We’re building online tools to make it easier for clients and florists to understand what an order will look like, from color palettes to shape and style.
